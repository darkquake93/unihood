Safe storage of passwords - After setting up the "Boxcryptor" Windows program, I quickly moved onto selecting my already existing "Important Notes" folder on Dropbox to be encrypted through Boxcryptor. 
The original folder has a large collection of important notes as in the title, and when these were encrypted they were all converted to Boxcryptor files instead, given the ".bc" extension. Hence, after using even higher-level credentials to sign into this program, I am only able to view my notes through this. Within the notes folder, of course, are my credentials for Amazon AWS. 
Then, I simply downloaded the Boxcryptor app for mobile also, for further ease of use in that I can sign in there when I do not have access to my home computer.

Putty, ssh etc files - Although it would be ideal to also have these encrypted, I have chosen not to, given these are not simple text files which means usually, and in this case, other programs and services are using them. Nevertheless, these security files are also stored in my Dropbox folder at the root.

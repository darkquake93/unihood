# UNI-HOOD

This is a proposal document for this "UniHood" project

My project aims to:

- Build a public facing database-backed website
- Provide the tools and structure that would allow it to scale to higher complexity 
- Document all steps of the procedure in a way that will allow others to reach similar level of functionality, with minimal effort
- Report, itemise and minimise any expenses
- Minimise actual coding via maximum deployment of existing open-source components. 
- Provide system documentation
- Address and Implement concepts such as:
    
    - Authentication
    - Authorisation
    - Security
    - Configuration
    - Source control
    - Issue management
    - Backup
    - Disaster Recovery
    - Scalability
    - Productivity
    - Automated testing
    - Continuous Intergration
    - Continuous Delivery

All steps are reported in the style of how-tos, observations, recommendations on strengths and weaknesses of choices made. Currently this project is using this GitHub site as a base repositry.

I would like for my project to focus on an Amazon (Free Tier) virtual machine providing these functionalities and in particular the optimal / custom alterations of the machine's OS' specifications such as RAM, Hard Disk space (as well as the procedure of adding an extra virtual drive known as an Elastic Block Store (EBS) to the virtual machine and so on.

In terms of the actual business application to be modelled there is scope for this to change at this early stage, however my current expectation is to build a site that allows a university community to review and comment on courses and modules in a more structured way than the typical forums and social networks.

This is a proposal document for this "UniHood" project

My project aims to:

- Report, itemise and minimise any expenses
- Record of all steps involved in building a database backed website
- Include reporting of concepts such as public facing, authentication, security, configuration and source control. 
- Issue management, backup, recoverability, scalability, minimum actual coding and maximum deployment of existing open-source components. 

All steps are reported in the style of how-tos, observations, recommendations on strengths and weaknesses of choices made. Currently this project is using this GitHub site as a base repositry.

I would like for my project to focus on the virtual machine providing these functionalities and in particular the optimal / custom alterations of the machine's OS' specifications such as RAM, Hard Disk space (as well as the procedure of adding an extra virtual drive known as an Elastic Block Store (EBS) to the virtual machine and so on.
